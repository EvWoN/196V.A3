      <h3>Writeup</h3>
      <p>For this Assignment, we decided to use a crypto dataset as it would be nice to compare the cryptocurrencies
          between each other. Using a line chart allowed us to easily create the comparisons between the currencies
          based on what metric the audience would like to view. We never really had an alternatives as we believed
          this was the best kind of graph suited. The work split between us pretty even, Jason was able to get the
          graph up while Cameron and David were able to help debug any problems that occurred. Making sure the
          drag dop down box was working probably took the most time, as we had to make sure that the graph was correct
          based on what metric was picked.</p>
