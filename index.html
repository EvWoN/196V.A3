      <h3>Writeup</h3>
      <p>We decided to use a crypto dataset to more thoroughly understand crypto-currencies
          from each other. Lines Charts have been used for finance data values for the longest time for good reason, line charts offer many benefits.
          Lines take up minimal visual space while offering the maximum amount of visual data. Each horizontal location is a data point.
          If you compare this to a pie-chart they can take up a lot of space but only show a few data values.
          If you wanted to show distribution over time with pie-charts you would need a new pie-chart for each time value, quickly making the visual crowded.
          Line charts on the other hand allow us to easily plot many different datasets while maintaining comparative legibility between the datasets.
          There weren't really any alternative visuals that we could have chosen from that make any sense so we didn't really waste any time on that.
          We did however have to make decisions on how to display the data. Did we wan't to go through the extra work to show all the datasets at once or just have two pre-selected.
          We decided it was important to show all dataset because that would give a unique overview that essentially relays the most important takeaways.
          Just based on the initial landing view when all datasets are displayed, we can already make out many trends.
          We can see where most crypto-currencies are valued at. We can see the very obvious outlier dominating the market value. We can also identify some major events be it falls or rise-ups.
      </p>
      <p>David and Cameron spent a lot of time trying to find multiline d3 starter code but it turned out to be harder than expected to find something that would work with this data set and offer exploratory interactivity.
          As the most experienced one in the group with web-development, Jason just decided to take a basic visual and implement the exploratory interactivity we had in mind from scratch. Making sure the
          drag dop down box was working probably took the most time, as we had to make sure that the graph was redrawn and scaled correctly based on the metric that was picked.
